      <!-- IMPORTANT: when adding dependency (module) here, make sure it is a public one.
           Do not add private modules as there is no guarantee they won't be changed or
           removed in future. EAP also generates warning(s) during the deployment if
           the WAR depends on private modules. -->

      <!-- Dom4j is a transitive dependency of org.apache.poi:poi-ooxml and needs to be on classpath.
           It is also used by Hibernate and adding it directly into WEB-INF/lib results in
           "org.dom4j.DocumentException: org.dom4j.DocumentFactory cannot be cast to org.dom4j.DocumentFactory"
           Depending on the EAP module seems to be the only way.
